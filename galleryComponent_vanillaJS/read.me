You need to run the project on a server in order to avoid CORS errors. I used live-server.
I couldn't tackle the unit testing because I didn't have enought time to mock the html and the response and then develop all the needed test.
The responsive is set to 768px.
It has been fully tested in Chrome (Windows and Mac), Firefox (Windows and Mac), Edge (Windows) and Safari (Mac).
Please if you find any unexpected behaviour let me know.

The gallery component is: gallery.js
The HTML+CSS including the gallery is: index.html.
